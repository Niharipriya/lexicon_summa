# lexicon_summa
In our project we have two different approaches for text summarization one is nltk summarizer and the other one is text summarizer which uses spacy for summarization.
nltk_summarizer: This function uses NLTK, a natural language processing library, to generate a summary of text. It calculates word frequencies, normalizes them, and assigns scores to sentences based on their word frequencies. The top sentences with the highest scores are selected as the summary.
